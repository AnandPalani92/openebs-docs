## Introduction

Elasticsearch is an open-source, RESTful, distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache License. Elasticsearch has quickly become the most popular search engine, and is commonly used for log analytics, full-text search, security intelligence, business analytics, and operational intelligence use cases. In this solution, running a ElasticSearch StatefulSet application on OpenEBS cStor volume and perform simple database operations to verify successful deployment.

## Requirements

1. **Install OpenEBS**

   If OpenEBS is not installed in your K8s cluster, this can done from [here](/docs/next/installation.html). If OpenEBS is already installed, go to the next step. 

2. **Configure cStor Pool**

   If cStor Pool is not configure in your OpenEBS cluster, this can be done from [here](/docs/next/configurepools.html). If cStor pool is already configured, go to the next step. Sample YAML named **openebs-config.yaml** for configuring cStor Pool is provided in the Configuration details below.

3. **Create Storage Class**

   You must configure a StorageClass to provision cStor volume on cStor pool. In this solution we are using a StorageClass to consume the cStor Pool which is created using external disks attached on the Nodes. The storage pool is created using the steps provided in the [Configure StoragePool](/docs/next/configurepools.html) section. Since Cassandra is a StaefulSet application, it requires only one replication at the storage level. So cStor volume `replicaCount` is 1. Sample YAML named **openebs-sc-disk.yaml**to consume cStor pool with cStorVolume Replica count as 1 is provided in the configuration details below.

## Deployment of ElasticSearch with OpenEBS

In this solution ,the number of replicas in the Statefulset can be modified as required. This example uses 3 application replicas. This means 3 Cassandra pods will be created after it successful deployment. 

Run the following command to install elasticsearch  services.

```

```

Now,you must create a new file called **elasticsearch -statefulset.yaml** and add the content from **elasticsearch -statefulset.yaml** shows in the Configuration details section below to this new file.

Once you added the contents to the new **elasticsearch -statefulset.yaml**,  you can run the following command to install ElasticSearch StatefulSet application.

```
kubectl apply -f 
```

## Verify ElasticSearch Pods

Run the following to get the status of ElasticSearch pods.

```
kubectl get pods
```

Following is an example output.

```

```
