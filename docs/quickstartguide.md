Following are the steps to get started with OpenEBS on a Kubernetes cluster.

### As Kubernetes operator / admin:

1. Check if open-iscsi is installed and running on kubelet. Know more <<TBD: Provide a link here >>

2. Install OpenEBS on the cluster by executing the following single command on the Kubernetes shell

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/openebs-operator.yaml
   ```

3. Create a catalog of storage classes and publish them to your developers for their use. Some ready to use storage classes are added to the cluster when OpenEBS is installed

### As application developer:

1. Create a PVC spec with the right storage class and use it in the application yaml file

2. Apply the yaml file using `kubectl apply -f` command and observe that an OpenEBS volume is provisioned and bound to the application pod
